      <h3>Dear checker!</h3>
      <p>We are pleased to present you SpotifyClone â€” an application made as part of the rsclone task.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, not everything that was conceived was realized, although we tried very hard. But there are a number of objective reasons for this, and perhaps the main one is the Spotify Api, which we used to get information.</p>
      <p>Firstly, you will need a valid Spotify account to log in to the app.</p>
      <p>Secondly, we need to give you access to the application in development mode. Therefore, please contact us to grant access (we need a email address linked to your Spotify account).</p>

      </div>
      <p>Thirdly, must say that the Spotify Api itself is not perfect, so if errors occur during operation, please pay attention to the type of error, perhaps this is a bad response from the server. Most often, the problem can be solved by reloading the page.</p>
      <p>Fourthly, Spotify Api only provides a 30-second preview of songs, and for some songs even it is not available.</p>
      <p>Also you can watch video presentation of the app.</p>
